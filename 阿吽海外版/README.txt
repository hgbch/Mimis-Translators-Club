Aunn OC rewrite by Yuu Takanashi - Yuu#4203
Latest revision: 31.05.2023

====
Why a rewrite?
====
The original dialogue had a total of 82 speech- and 145 non-speech lines and didn't do Aunn enough justice.
Furthermore there were major dialogue inconsistencies and coding bugs (ex. B caress = C caress, timestop/sleep talk, copy-pasted lines etc.).
After finishing my translation, I shared my findings with other contributors and community members, and asked around if a complete rewrite and overhaul would make sense.
And, after further consideration, started this project shortly thereafter on the 2nd of December 2022.


====
About Aunn's character
====
I based her character and dialogue on the following:
- Her Stage 3 dialogue(s) in HSiFS
- Her scenario and dialogue as a protagonist/opponent in UDoALG
- Her short appearance in WaHH Chapter 42
- Her concept art in WaHH
- Her brief cameos in LE
- Her article in "Who's Who of Humans & Youkai - Everlasting Edition"
- ZUN's drawing of her in his Nikenme Radio Event from 27.12.2018
- Her comments in the Grimoire of Usami

With this in mind I wrote her as follows:
- Demeanor/Actions
Radiant. Fluffy. Overbearing. Oblivious. Curious. --Like a cute excited dog.
- Dialogue
Direct. Blunt. Polite. Bigmouthed. Shy.  --Like someone who enjoys conversation, but turns meek when pressed.


====
Route options
====
Please note that, as of the latest revision, Aunn only has a love route. There are also a handful of special lines and cases for when she is your Lover.
There are currently no plans to support a lust route. Dialogue for time stop- and sleep rape is also currently not planned.
I also highly discourage to do anything lewd with her before gaining "Love", but obviously it's your choice!


====
Ending
====
The ending is triggered through the "Conversation" option after you've seen all unique events.
You can check Aunn's character profile in-game for which ones you've encountered. The hints below are sorted the same as the list in-game.
Don't worry, the game doesn't actually end after this. It's more meant as an epilogue and feedback to the player that he has seen all unique events.
Your choice during the ending event has no impact on further gameplay and is simply there for immersion sake.

                     !!! --------------------------------------- !!!
                     !!! Hints to achieve the ending (SPOILERS): !!!
                     !!! --------------------------------------- !!!
                     - Danmaku is really important in Gensokyo, isn't it?
                     - Aunn seems really bitter about her loss against Cirno in HSiFS. Maybe you can help her win in a rematch?
                     - Use the conversation option a lot. She has so much to learn from you! (While not on a date!)
                     - Show and talk to Aunn where Reimu and Marisa faced off against the respective games' final boss! (While on a date!)
                     - Go on a date to the human village with her and check out some of the local sights.
                     - Hats are pretty important in Gensokyo and Aunn is lacking one. Maybe the shopping district in the Human Village has something for her? (Conversation command while on a date [not guaranteed, so do it lots!])
                     - Kourindou has a lot of interesting wares. Maybe you should take Aunn there during a date? (Conversation command)
                     - The Road of Liminality would make for a good dating spot with its festival-like stands! (Conversation command)
                     - (Currently not enabled: The Human Village is a bit strange. Really makes you wonder who all lives there. (Conversation option while on a date - a lot.))
                     - I'm an old man so naturally, just like the Japanese, I really like fishing. Of course you don't need to be a fishing god for the ending though...
                     - Maybe there's something fun you can do in the Lunar Capital? (Conversation command)
                     - Kiss kiss, fall in love [...] - (Song referenced, albeit irrelevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi4JLywH_cA)
                     - Surely you wouldn't turn down a confession of hers, right? Do you perhaps have someone else already? Well, even that can be remedied! There is an option somewhere that allows you to build a harem...
                     - If she is repeatedly begging for something, maybe it's best to cave in and heed her request?
                     - That tail of hers... It sure is intriguing, isn't it? And I did add some new functionality to the "Do Nothing" (during sex) command...

                     - If you are still stumped after this, there's a direct explanation in "M_KOJO_K120_FUNC.ERB" in the comments of method "K120_ENDING_POSSIBLE"

About Aunn's relationships and knowledge of other characters
====
Friends:
Reimu and Marisa are frequently shown interacting and talking with Aunn after the events of HSiFS. This is also shown in WaHH Chapter 42.
- Reimu
Aunn does a lot of work for and generally helps Reimu in many of her cameos in LE, so I'd like to leave panel 2 of this as a general pointer: https://mangadex.org/chapter/bd526476-03f1-4bda-838d-378fbed07c43/11

- Marisa
In Marisa's case she's also shown goofing around with her in LE Ch.1 - Page 15 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/bb55024a-8c7c-4fc2-911e-845dc3bca208/15) and Ch.2 Page 13 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/68d47707-e9f1-4f02-8919-489186c7108d/13)
They also talk to each other in LE Ch.22 - Page 25 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/e318e0a1-ac2c-4f5f-8733-a32186ef6a03/25)
Aunn also tries to cheer her up after losing all her money gambling in LE Ch.30 - Page 25 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/9f57b077-0193-4c0e-875b-97f78b0ead85/25)

- Cirno
So on this one I had her Stage 3 dialogue in mind much more strongly than her LE cameos, causing me to initially write them as quasi enemies. (https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons/Story/Cirno's_Scenario#Stage_3)
But after going back and looking at Aunn's and Cirno's interaction with each other in LE, I decided to rewrite it entirely and have them be honest to god friends instead. I mean, just look at them...:
https://mangadex.org/chapter/bb55024a-8c7c-4fc2-911e-845dc3bca208/26
https://mangadex.org/chapter/bb55024a-8c7c-4fc2-911e-845dc3bca208/30

https://mangadex.org/chapter/1b607065-8316-4311-8bab-2779479b264a/14
https://mangadex.org/chapter/07bd094e-9227-4e04-951f-0421eee4120b/16

Friendly:
- Remilia
Shown to have Aunn give her paw like a dog in LE Ch.2 - Page 15 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/68d47707-e9f1-4f02-8919-489186c7108d/15)

- Three Fairies of Light
Aunn is shown sharing offerings(?) with them in LE Ch.9 - Page 5 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/559116f7-cb84-4782-b18f-1e02ef9021a1/5)

- Kasen
Shown interacting together WaHH Ch.42+. We've never seen them together again (RIP WaHH and Kasen ;_;), but at the time they were very friendly towards each other.

- Miyoi
Shown attending a banquet together (and in close proximity), but not interacting -> LE Ch.1 - Page 25 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/bb55024a-8c7c-4fc2-911e-845dc3bca208/25)
Miyoi is then later shown letting Aunn wear her hat in LE Ch.22 - Page 19 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/e318e0a1-ac2c-4f5f-8733-a32186ef6a03/19) and still interacting by Page 25 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/e318e0a1-ac2c-4f5f-8733-a32186ef6a03/25)
Also shows them working together in LE Ch.27 - Page 14 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/a918fdca-f229-41cf-98b2-e45edb1495dc/14) and Page 16 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/a918fdca-f229-41cf-98b2-e45edb1495dc/16)

Neutral:
- Okina
While Aunn refers to Okina the same as to Reimu and Marisa (-san), I left it somewhat neutral, because it did not seem like Okina cared much about her, outside of as an advertisement for her greatness.
Thus I settled on Aunn simply thinking of Okina as "the person who created me".

- Sanae
Shown in (https://mangadex.org/chapter/5aa9c012-6c51-4c26-9bc5-29e579bb0d44/21 [Thanks KR for finding it!]) to spy on the Moriya shrine and their event to gather infos and use it for Reimu and her shrine's sake.

Knows of (canon):
- Yukari
Shown attending a banquet together (and in close proximity), but not interacting -> LE Ch.1 - Page 15 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/bb55024a-8c7c-4fc2-911e-845dc3bca208/15)
I extended this to Reimu also mentioning her name once in passing (not canon).
"Ah, that youko over there? That's Ran, Yukari's shikigami. She helps maintain the barrier. Who is Yukari? Ah... she's a bit annoying and talking about her might summon her, so let's not..."
Like that.
- Yuyuko
Shown attending a banquet together (and in close proximity), but not interacting -> LE Ch.1 - Page 15 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/bb55024a-8c7c-4fc2-911e-845dc3bca208/15) and again in Ch.2 - Page 13 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/68d47707-e9f1-4f02-8919-489186c7108d/13)
- Youmu
Shown attending a banquet together (and in close proximity), but not interacting -> LE Ch.1 - Page 15 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/bb55024a-8c7c-4fc2-911e-845dc3bca208/15) and again in Ch.2 - Page 13 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/68d47707-e9f1-4f02-8919-489186c7108d/13)
- Suika
Shown attending a banquet together (and in close proximity), but not interacting -> LE Ch.1 - Page 25 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/bb55024a-8c7c-4fc2-911e-845dc3bca208/25) and again in Ch.2 - Page 13 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/68d47707-e9f1-4f02-8919-489186c7108d/13)
- Sakuya
Shown attending a banquet together (and in close proximity), but not interacting -> LE Ch.1 - Page 25 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/bb55024a-8c7c-4fc2-911e-845dc3bca208/25) and again in Ch.2 - Page 13 (https://mangadex.org/chapter/68d47707-e9f1-4f02-8919-489186c7108d/13)
Here's a good shot with the 4 above: https://mangadex.org/chapter/ba4895ad-4525-4167-86c9-480b5cb4be55/2
- Nazrin
Fights her in TH19. Seems to have known her prior, because she exclaims "The one from the temple!". In VS she also accuses Nazrin of stealing donations.
- Seiran
Fights her in TH19. Nothing major happens, but she understand that she's a rabbit from the moon. In Seiran's VS win against Aunn she exclaims her desire to hang out with Aunn at the shrine.

Knows of (not canon):
- Ran
Since she checks the border for problems and her workplace in TW is at the shrine, I figured the player might find it weird if Aunn didn't at least know of her. This also roots Aunn's character a little bit better into her surroundings.

- Aya
"A pesky crow tengu that likes to snoop around the shrine from time to time" - I went with this simple statement. If ZUN deems to have her appear extensively in every recent official written/drawn work, then I'll just follow his example.

Extra commands via command "Do Nothing"
====
There are extra fetish commands under "Do Nothing" during a Push Down. Despite the command's original name, they act the same as if executing a usual command; altogether with EXP gain etc.

Special implementation for "Pillow Talk" and "Be Seduced"

Regarding the presented fetishes
====
This section contains minor spoilers regarding fetishes - no direct details and only "pointers" - but if you like to get surprised, you should skip over this.

       Spoilers start now - Final warning

Aunn has, let's call it..., an inclination for insemination and as such may beg you for it, if conditions are right.
You may find out the reason behind this through the daily conversation command, if conditions are right.

As the fur of a Komainu, and thus also Aunn's hair, is extravagant and they're described as "lion-dog beasts", there will be mentioning of Aunn's pubic hair.
I have tried to not go overboard with these descriptions, using it mostly for flavor and characterization and hope that it is not too disruptive to gameplay when it is not your cup of tea.
Currently there is no toggle for the pubic hair description, but if enough people complain, I will build one.

During gameplay you may be asked if you want to do stuff to Aunn's armpits. Going ahead with this will toggle on armpit related actions during some events.
This does not affect the "Do Nothing" selection.

       Spoilers end here

Regarding typos, bugs, wishes and complaints

DM me at Yuu#4203 or ping me in the /egg/ Discord server.
If you are lucky a thread under #era-games should also exist.
I very, very, very rarely read the /egg/ thread on /jp/, so don't count on me being there.
