				PRINTFORMDW Aunn looks at the piece of paper and her excitement quickly turns into disappointment.
				PRINTFORML 「Are people really throwing their trash out like this...?」
				PRINTFORMDW She scans her surroundings, but doesn't find a culprit.
				PRINTFORMDW Considering how waterlogged it is, the culprit is likely long gone.
				PRINTFORMDW Aunn heaves a heavy sigh and hands you the talisman.
				PRINTFORML 「Don't go throwing it into a river, okay?」
				PRINTFORMDW You nod vehemently and tell her you're not the littering kind...

						PRINTFORMDW It does indeed not seem very popular and you wonder if it's a case of botched advertising...
					CASE 1
						PRINTFORML 「Gununu...」
						PRINTFORML 「Littering to this extend! This is an incident, is it not?!」
						PRINTFORMW 「I should tell Reimu-san!」
						PRINTFORMDW Despite saying so, Aunn suddenly falls quiet with her arms crossed and her eyes closed shut.
						PRINTFORMDW Just when you try to prod her, she jumps into action and strikes a heroic pose.
						PRINTFORML 「No! It's time for this Komainu to shine!」
						PRINTFORML 「I'll go out, confront Sanae-san and solve this incident myself!」
						PRINTFORMDW Worried she'll cause more upset than solve, you try to dissuade her from her idea.
						PRINTFORML 「It's fine! I'll do it in Reimu-san's name so it'll also be faith collecting!」
						PRINTFORMDW That might cause an actual incident on its own.
						PRINTFORML 「Ah, but... Sanae-san is kinda strong...」
						PRINTFORMDW Aunn sits down again, looking defeated before she even got started.
						PRINTFORML 「There's no way I can beat her...」
						PRINTFORMDW You pat Aunn's head and try to cheer her up...
					CASE 2
						PRINTFORMDW Aunn takes the talisman close to her face and squints her eyes at it.
						PRINTFORML 「It doesn't even guarantee a miracle...」
						PRINTFORML 「So what exactly is the purpose of these?」
						PRINTFORMDW You explain how and why people are really infatuated with the draw of luck.
						PRINTFORML 「But doesn't that mean you are really likely to spend more than you actually gain?」
						PRINTFORML 「Marisa-san also gambled all her money away in the Human Village's gambling hall.」
						PRINTFORMW 「If not even Marisa-san can beat the odds, then gambling's really bad, right?」
						PRINTFORMDW You nod wistfully and tell her that you wish people would come to the same conclusion...

				PRINTFORMDW The thick branch, approximately the size of your forearm, is tangled in algae and heavily waterlogged.
				PRINTFORMDW There's a clean split running across its center which is filled with various freshwater mollusks.
				PRINTFORMDW Despite the damage the water has done to it, its coloring has barely faded.
				PRINTFORMDW The bark is a mature, baked brown color with a sandy undertone.
				PRINTFORMDW Through the crack you notice that its pith is red in color.
				PRINTFORMDW Your mind is immediately taken to the peak of the Youkai Mountain, famous for its Hibai trees.
				PRINTFORMDW In your thoughts, this spiritual journey has you following a squirrel as it sits atop one of its branches.
				PRINTFORMDW Unbeknownst to it, a marten with light brown fur and a white patch on its chest, is crawling up the tree's backside.
				PRINTFORMDW Once it reaches the base of the branch the squirrel finally notices his enemy.
				PRINTFORMDW Shambling away from it, towards the very end, it contemplates taking the leap.
				PRINTFORMDW The marten stalks ever closer, the branch cracks under their combined weight and--
				PRINTFORMDL --CRACK
				PRINTFORMDW It gives way, snaps and tumbles down together with the two animals.
				PRINTFORMDW However you don't follow them, instead watching the branch roll off the cliffside, falling and tumbling until meeting with the bend of a brook.
				PRINTFORMDW The water runs clear and the bed is set with smooth stones.
				PRINTFORMDW The branch lodges itself upright into the brook's bed and holds steadfast against the current.
				PRINTFORMDW Seasons pass, debris hits, wraps and lodges itself in and around the branch, creating a natural dam.
				PRINTFORMDW Now also housing various small freshwater life, the brook's flow is changed, toiling to bend around it.
				PRINTFORMDW Until a disgruntled white wolf Tengu approaches.
				PRINTFORMDW With a curse and a grunt, she dislodges the dam and the branch, sending it back down the brook.
				PRINTFORMDW The current turns faster and faster, from one bend to another.
				PRINTFORMDW Sometimes joining another, sometimes being joined.
				PRINTFORMDW It's pulled under, circles helplessly and tries to float back to the top, but is ultimately unable to do so.
				PRINTFORMDW Then, suddenly, a shiny object collides with it and firmly lodges into its side.
				PRINTFORMDW There's a reaction and with an abrupt motion the branch is pulled back to the light.
				PRINTFORMDW You see the branch.
				PRINTFORMDW You see yourself and Aunn.
				PRINTFORMDW A sudden shock temporarily robs you of your vision and you snap out of it, shaking off the intense vertigo.
				PRINTFORML 「E-Everything okay? You are strangely focused on examining this random piece of wood...」
				PRINTFORMDW You are unsure how to go about explaining what you just experienced and simply nod your head...

						PRINTFORMW 「And here I thought we finally caught a big fish...」
					CASE 2
						PRINTFORMW 「That's not a fish...」
